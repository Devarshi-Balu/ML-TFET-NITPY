# MachineLearning with TFET 




# Note  : 
    1. At some parts of the code "Ignore Nc" might be observed - but actually Tsi is ignored, Nc is taken into account and 
        it is not ignored anywhere.
        Nc was ignored at inital stages to check the performance of the model without Nc, but later the approach is continued,
        Nc is taken into account.
    2. Files greater than 30MB cannot be uploaded into the github - The same repository is also uploaded in the google drive 
        Drive link : 
    3. Make sure you provide right paths of the datsets while training 
    4. Each folder contains a readme markup file, please look into it for further details of each model.
